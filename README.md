# Holberton School Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C, as part of the Holberton School curriculum. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate C file, and the repository includes a header file defining function prototypes and structures.

# Sorting Algorithms Included:

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Quick Sort

# Usage:

Each sorting algorithm is showcased in a dedicated C file along with a main function demonstrating its usage. The algorithms can be compiled and executed independently for educational purposes and practical understanding of sorting techniques.
